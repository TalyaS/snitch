# Snitch

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

## Setup

Snitch uses bower-rails as browser-related package manager (and bundler for server-related package manager). 
To add a browser-related dependency, add it to bower.json and run:

    rake bower:install


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
